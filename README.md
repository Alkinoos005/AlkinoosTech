# Hi there 👋 AlkinoosTech here

I'm Alkinoos, I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer undergraduate that's passionate about programming based in Greece!

I design and bringt to life whatever my wild and unique imagination commands me to do.

If an idea pops into my head , I'm going straight to creation mode and hopefully I will succeed on my first try.Else I'm having all nighter sessions.

My main tools are my laptop, geek for geeks, genuine youtube turtorials, free books from the library amd older electrical engineers with LLMs advices that then I implement and finally create.

I am an active member an Electronics and an Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security team. Enjoying every moment of creating meaningfull projects and collecting every drop of knowledge from different fields.

Fun Facts about me:
~ Hobbies: basketball, poetry club , coding and building interesting projects 
~ I'm  a member of a photography club
~I don't drink coffee
~Lord of the rings is my favourite trilogy
